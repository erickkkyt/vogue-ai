        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Getting Started: Navigate to Your Creation Hub</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Module 1: Crafting Your Baby&apos;s Visual Identity</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The first module focuses entirely on your baby&apos;s appearance. You&apos;ll encounter three distinct creation pathways:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Feature-Based Generation:</strong> Select from dropdown menus for ethnicity and hair characteristics. The system provides preset options plus custom input fields for unique specifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Custom Image Upload:</strong> Already have the perfect baby image? Upload it directly through our drag-and-drop interface with instant preview functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Portrait-to-Baby Transformation:</strong> Upload any portrait photo and watch our AI transform it into an adorable baby version using advanced facial mapping technology.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Each option includes real-time validation and helpful tooltips to guide your selections. The interface adapts dynamically based on your chosen method, showing only relevant controls.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Module 2: Engineering Your Podcast Content</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The second module handles all content creation aspects. This purple-badged section offers three sophisticated content generation methods:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Topic-Driven AI Generation:</strong> Enter any subject matter (politics, economics, trending topics) and our AI creates compelling podcast scripts automatically. The system includes character counting and credit-based length limits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Recorded Audio Integration:</strong> Upload existing audio files through our advanced audio trimming tool. You can precisely select segments, with duration limits based on your available credits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Direct Script Input:</strong> Paste or type your complete script into our expandable text editor. Features include real-time character counting, formatting preservation, and credit-based length validation.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Each content method includes an integrated voice selector component, offering multiple AI voice options with preview capabilities. The interface displays credit requirements transparently for each selection.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Module 3: Optimizing Video Output Parameters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The final green-badged module fine-tunes your video&apos;s technical specifications through a dual-column grid layout:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Resolution Selection:</strong> Choose between 540p (Standard) for efficient processing or 720p (2x credits) for premium quality. Each option clearly displays credit consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aspect Ratio Optimization:</strong> Select from 9:16 (Vertical/Mobile), 1:1 (Square/Social), or 16:9 (Widescreen) with platform-specific recommendations highlighted in different colors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Execution: The AI Create Process</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          After completing all three modules, the prominent &quot;AI Create&quot; button becomes active. This gradient-styled button features a sparkle icon and transforms on hover, providing clear visual feedback. The system performs comprehensive validation before submission.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Upon clicking, a confirmation modal appears with project details. After confirmation, the system displays real-time processing status with color-coded notifications. Success messages include estimated completion times (typically 3 minutes) and direct links to project monitoring.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Pro Tips for Maximum Success</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Monitor your credit balance throughout the process, experiment with different voice options using the preview feature, and leverage the character counting tools to maximize content within your credit limits. The dashboard&apos;s responsive design ensures seamless creation across all devices, making viral content creation truly accessible anywhere.
