        <p className="mb-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The first module focuses entirely on your baby&apos;s appearance. You&apos;ll encounter three distinct creation pathways:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The second module handles all content creation aspects. This purple-badged section offers three sophisticated content generation methods:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">

          Each content method includes an integrated voice selector component, offering multiple AI voice options with preview capabilities. The interface displays credit requirements transparently for each selection.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Module 3: Optimizing Video Output Parameters</h3>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          The final green-badged module fine-tunes your video&apos;s technical specifications through a dual-column grid layout:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 pl-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Resolution Selection:</strong> Choose between 540p (Standard) for efficient processing or 720p (2x credits) for premium quality. Each option clearly displays credit consumption.

        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          After completing all three modules, the prominent &quot;AI Create&quot; button becomes active. This gradient-styled button features a sparkle icon and transforms on hover, providing clear visual feedback. The system performs comprehensive validation before submission.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Upon clicking, a confirmation modal appears with project details. After confirmation, the system displays real-time processing status with color-coded notifications. Success messages include estimated completion times (typically 3 minutes) and direct links to project monitoring.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6 text-white">Pro Tips for Maximum Success</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          Monitor your credit balance throughout the process, experiment with different voice options using the preview feature, and leverage the character counting tools to maximize content within your credit limits.
