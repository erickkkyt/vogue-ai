    },
    {
      question: 'Is AI Baby Generator legal to monetize?',

    {
      question: 'How much can I earn from creating AI Baby Generator content?',

    {
      question: 'How do I make my AI Baby Generator stand out?',

    },
    {
      question: 'Can I use copyrighted content in my AI Baby Generator videos?',
